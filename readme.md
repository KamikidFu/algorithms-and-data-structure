# Algorithms and data structures
*An overall note about algorithms and data structures repo*

## Intro
### What is algorithm?
A series of steps to accomplish a task.
### What is data structure?
A collection of data to provide efficient access and modification.
### How to write an algorithm?
* Understand the final goal
* Think about the pathway to the goal
* Break it down to pieces
* Solve them and try to simplify them
* Review and refactor
### How to analyse an algorithm?
There are two factors to analyse an algorithm which are:
* Time Complexity
* Space Complexity

Normally using Big-O notation, but there are Big-Theta and Big-Omega notations for representing complexity as well.
