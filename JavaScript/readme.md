# Algorithms and data structures
*A note for JavaScript implementation*

## Topics
### Common Patterns
> See [*CommonPatterns.js*](https://github.com/KamikidFu/algorithms-and-data-structure/blob/master/JavaScript/CommonPatterns.js)
---
#### Frequency Count
**Goal:**

To avoid nested looping and reduce the time complexity

**Example Tasks:**

1. Write an algorithm named `isSame` which accepts two arrays to check if they have identical elements.
2. Write an algorithm named `isAnagram` which allows two strings and determine if they are anagram.

---
#### Multiple Pointer
**Goal:**

To create different pointer to point at different index or position

**Example Tasks:**

1. Write an algorithm names `pickZeroSum` which accepts an array of integers and output pairs of integers which the sum of these two is zero.
2. Write an algorithm names `countUniqueValue` which allows a sorted array of integers and output how many unique integers in the array.
---
#### Sliding Window
**Goal:**

To find a meaningful slice in an array.

**Example Tasks:**

1. Write an algorithm named `maxSubarraySum` which uses an array of integers and an integer number determining the subarray size to output the maximum sum.
2. Write an algorithm named `findLongestUniqueSubstring` which accepts a string and output the longest substring with all unique characters.
---
#### Divide and Conquer
**Goal:**

To divide a data set into smaller chunks and then repeat a process with a subset of data.

**Example Tasks:**
1. Write an algorithm named `binarySearch` which needs a sorted array of integer and a number which is this algorithm looking for.
